# PokeFusion
A small utility to display two randomly selected pokemon. Then the intent is an artist can take the two and combine them into a fusion. Eventually I plan on displaying submitted artworks of the fusion.

## Inspiration
Initially a friend of mine just wanted ideas to draw, and she likes pokemon. I was probably inspired by the Pokemon Fusion site since I've seen that before as well (http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/). Otherwise just browsing tumblr and seeing posts about Steven Universe.

## Notes
This is still very new if you find this now, nothing here yet.
